## React Demo Program

This is a tiny demonstration exercise just to see how to approach React programming.

To do the exercise:
 * Fork this repository on github.
 * Make sure you can run the code. You'll need to install dependencies.
It should produce a big blue box in your favourite browser when you run it.
 * Add code to your version of the exercise to allow the user to add
 circles inside the blue box by pressing a button. Just fixed-sized circles, as many as the user wants. Make the circles draggable to reposition them. Remember the position of all the circles in React state.
 * If you are really enthusiastic you could try drawing connections between circles, or changing their color, or anything more interesting. But really this is just an exercise in copying and understanding code, React and git.
 * when you're finished, you can commit your code to your repository and send a pull request back here.
 * Feel free to use any technology you want. Any open source library, any ready-made solution.

 Have fun!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
